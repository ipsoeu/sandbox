            <h3>Temporal evolution of the twitter activity and event detection</h3>

            <div>

                In this section we will show the trends regarding news and events of the tweets collected from July 2020
                to June 2021 about contact tracing apps.
                The idea is to detect events during the relevant activity in twitter and for each event try to
                understand in an automatic way what happened.
                Reusing the sentiment orientation (positive/negative) of the tweets, we have extracted the temporal
                evolution of both positive and negative events.
                Furthermore, we performed a cross check between pages linked in tweets and the GDELT database to
                identify relevant news items.
                Combining the relevant news and the number of re-tweets, we have ranked the events and discarded the
                least interesting ones.
                In addition, we identified the top hashtags and the countries involved in each event.
                With this information we tried to understand the main events regarding the contact tracing apps and the
                thoughts of the twitter users.
            </div>
            <div>
                <svg id="events_by_app" width="1300" height="600"></svg>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Figure 1 – Time series of the tweets mentioning the six most important contact tracing apps and
                    potential event identification.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>

                Figure 1 shows twitter users’ activity relevant to the six most important mobile contact tracing apps.
                The red circles denote potential events that have been detected using the z-score function output.
                The z-score value of a (potential) event detected is calculated according to the following formula:

                <p>
                    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                        <mi>z-score</mi>
                        <mo>=</mo>
                        <mfrac>
                            <mi>number of tweets by day - mean total count tweets</mi>
                            <mi>standard deviation total count tweets</mi>
                        </mfrac>
                    </math>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only potential events with a z-score value greater than 1 are displayed in Figure 1, and the size of
                    the circle is proportional to the z-score value.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <table id="events_by_zscore"></table>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Table 1 - Events detected using the z-score function.
                </div>
                <p>
                    Table 1 displays the events detected sorted by the z-score function.
                    Also, the table reports for each event the number of tweets and the main 3 contact tracing mobile
                    apps.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Event detection based on tweets with opinion</h3>

            <p>
                In this section we focus on positive and negative events, taking advantage of the identification of the
                opinions
                (positive/negative) expressed in the relevant tweets that took place in the <a
                    href="/index_contact_tracing_apps_sentiment_analysis.html">Sentiment analysis</a> section.
                This way, we extract from the tweet time series of Figure 1 only the twitter activity that involves
                positive tweets, to identify potential positive events.
            </p>


            <div>
                <svg id="positive_events_by_app" width="1300" height="600"></svg>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Figure 2 - Time series of the positive tweets mentioning the six most important contact tracing apps
                    and potential event identification.
                </div>
                Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of positive tweets, and we can observe that the events with the
                highest z-score value took place during the second wave of the pandemic (autumn 2020).
                Furthermore, the event on Sept 24, 2020 has the highest z-score value (9.6), which means that the number
                of tweets is higher than the mean average.
                For the rest of the events displayed in Table 2, we have a z-score value between 5.7 and 2.2.
            </div>

            <div>
                <table id="positive_events_by_zscore"></table>
                <div class=".figure_caption">

                    six most important contact tracing apps.
                </div>

            </div>
            <div>
                As is shown in Figure 3, the landscape of the potential negative events is a little different from that
                of the positive ones:
                The z-score for the top 10 events is almost linear in the range 5 - 3 (see Table 3 for details), and the
                events did not take place only during the second wave.

        <div>
            <h3>Enhancing event detection with news and re-tweet</h3>

            In the previous section we identified potential events based on the z-score and the number of tweets;
            an outcome of this analysis is Table 4, where we present the potential events with a z-score greater than
            4.5,
            together with statistics on the news linked in the relevant tweets and the total number of retweets.
            This additional information allows us to identify more clearly the importance of the events, since the total
            number of retweets denotes how much the news has been shared.
