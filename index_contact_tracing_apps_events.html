            <h3>Temporal evolution of the twitter activity and event detection</h3>
            
            <div>

                In this section we will show the trends regarding news and events of the tweets collected from July 2020 to June 2021 about contact tracing apps. 
                The idea is to detect events during the relevant activity in twitter and for each event try to understand in an automatic way what happened. 
                Reusing the sentiment orientation (positive/negative) of the tweets, we have extracted the temporal evolution of both positive and negative events. 
                Furthermore, we performed a cross check between pages linked in tweets and the GDELT database to identify relevant news items. 
                Combining the relevant news and the number of re-tweets, we have ranked the events and discarded the least interesting ones. 
                In addition, we identified the top hashtags and the countries involved in each event. 
                With this information we tried to understand the main events regarding the contact tracing apps and the thoughts of the twitter users.
            </div>

                <svg id="events_by_app" width="1300" height="600"></svg>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Figure 1 – Time series of the tweets mentioning the six most important contact tracing apps and potential event identification.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div>
                
                Figure 1 shows twitter users’ activity relevant to the six most important mobile contact tracing apps. 
                The red circles denote potential events that have been detected using the z-score function output. 
                The z-score value of a (potential) event detected is calculated according to the following formula:
                
                <p>
                    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                        <mi>z-score</mi>
                        <mo>=</mo>
                        <mfrac>
                            <mi>number of tweets by day - mean total count tweets</mi>
                            <mi>standard deviation total count tweets</mi>
                        </mfrac>
                    </math>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only potential events with a z-score value greater than 1 are displayed in Figure 1, and the size of the circle is proportional to the z-score value.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <table id="events_by_zscore"></table>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Table 1 - Events detected using the z-score function.
                </div>
                <p>
                    Table 1 displays the events detected sorted by the z-score function.
                    Also, the table reports for each event the number of tweets and the main 3 contact tracing mobile apps.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Event detection based on tweets with opinion</h3>
            
            <p>
                In this section we focus on positive and negative events, taking advantage of the identification of the opinions 
                (positive/negative) expressed in the relevant tweets that took place in the <a href="/index_contact_tracing_apps_sentiment_analysis.html" >Sentiment analysis</a> section. 
                This way, we extract from the tweet time series of Figure 1 only the twitter activity that involves positive tweets, to identify potential positive events.
            </p>

                <svg id="positive_events_by_app" width="1300" height="600"></svg>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Figure 2 - Time series of the positive tweets mentioning the six most important contact tracing apps and potential event identification.
                </div>
                Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of positive tweets, and we can observe that the events with the highest z-score value took place during the second wave of the pandemic (autumn 2020). 
                Furthermore, the event on Sept 24, 2020 has the highest z-score value (9.6), which means that the number of tweets is higher than the mean average. 
                For the rest of the events displayed in Table 2, we have a z-score value between 5.7 and 2.2.
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <table id="positive_events_by_zscore"></table>
                <div class=".figure_caption">
                    Table 2 - Events detected using the z-score function on tweets with positive opinions mentioning the six most important contact tracing apps.

            </div>
            <div>
                As is shown in Figure 3, the landscape of the potential negative events is a little different from that of the positive ones: 
                The z-score for the top 10 events is almost linear in the range 5 - 3 (see Table 3 for details), and the events did not take place only during the second wave.

        <div>
            <h3>Enhancing event detection with news and re-tweet</h3>

            In the previous section we identified potential events based on the z-score and the number of tweets; 
            an outcome of this analysis is Table 4, where we present the potential events with a z-score greater than 4.5, 
            together with statistics on the news linked in the relevant tweets and the total number of retweets. 
            This additional information allows us to identify more clearly the importance of the events, since the total number of retweets denotes how much the news has been shared.
            
            <table id="events_news_ranking"></table>
            <div class=".figure_caption">

            <h3>Positive event on 24 Sept, 2020 - Lounch of the NHS Covid-19 Apps</h3>
            <svg id="dashboard_event_1" width="1300" height="600"></svg>
            <p>The above images combines a geographical visualization and a word cloud of the <em>positive</em> event detected on 
                24 Sept, 2020. The map show the high number of tweets occured in UK regarding the contact tracing
                mobile app <emd>NHS coronavirus APP</emd>. The word cloud represents the hashtags extracted with the relative 
                frequency. Inspecting in a manually way the tweets that contain the hashtags <em>haveyoudownloaded</em> 
                we can understand that the 24 Sept is the launch date of the NHS coronavirus APP
            </p>
            <p>
                Combining the linked pages on tweets and the GDELT observatory we have been extracted 59 tweets where the related links are detected by GDELT as news.
                In details, 23 neutral tweets, 17 positive tweets and 3 negative, as we aspected the number of positive news-tweets is greather than the negative tweet-news.
                Sorting the positive tweets by <em>favorite count</em> and get first tweet-news we can deduce what it's about the positive event detected. Following the 
                text of the tweet-news and the linked page, the author of the tweet is a governative organization:
                <p><em>
                        We've worked extensively to develop an app that's secure, simple to use; will help keep us safe.

                </p>
                Also, GDELT provids a classification of the news usinf the codelist CAMEO and a georeference information.
