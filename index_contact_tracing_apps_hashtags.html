        <h3>Hashtags network analysis</h3>

        <figure class="figure">

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1. Hashtag network about contact tracing apps, built on top of
                ~260,000 tweets collected from July 2020 to June 2021. </figcaption>
        </figure>



        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">

            <p>
                The picture shows the network hashtags of around 260,000 tweets about mobile contact tracing apps. 
                The tweets were collected from July 2020 to June 2021 using the official Twitter APIs. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The size of the nodes denotes the co-occurrence frequency with the other hashtags
                which means how a node may be influential in the network.
                Different measures can be adopted in Social Network Analysis (SNA) 
                to extract the centrality of a node in order to obtain an influential node. We adopted as
                centrality measurement the degree centrality wich shows how many connections an hashtags has.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please notice that the small communities with a low number of nodes and density are 
                pruned from the network in order to have a clearer overview of the network. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each colour represents a community, identified using the Louvain method [LOUVAIN-2008], where the hashtags are closely related. 
                For example, for the purple community the topic seems to be <em>Health and Healthcare</em>. 
                Note that the colours of the communities are selected randomly using standard colour palettes. 
            </p>

        </div>

        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
            <p>

                The Louvain method revealed 8 main distinct communities, where the <em>central hashtag</em> is usually a contact tracing app name. 
                For example, the dark green community represents the Italian contact tracing app <em>Immuni</em>, and the medium green community 
                the Irish contact tracing app <em>Covid Ireland</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, in grey there are small communities where the hashtags are related for most of the themes with political entities or geographic names. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
            <p>
                The table below displays the all the communities extracted using the [LOUVAIN-2008] algorithm and sorted by the number of hashtags. 
                The communities detected usually represent specific topics, entities or events but it is not easy to extract in 
                an automatic way a single word that describes each community. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For this reason, we provide for the most frequent contact tracing app in the <em>isolated</em> tweets 
                related to each community (specified in the column Main mobile app in Table 1) 
                the Top 5 hashtags (in the homonym column of Table 1), which allows to understand which topics dominate the community. 
                The top 5 hashtags are determined based on the highest value of degree centrality. 
                Note that, since every hashtag may be used in one or more tweets, 
                a community is determined by a set of tweets and the size of the set is reported in the <em>number of tweets</em> column.
            </p>

            <p>

                On the other hand, a tweet can contain one or more hashtags and a community can share tweets with the other communities. 
                The <em>Isolation index</em> shows how much a community is isolated and it has been calculated as the ratio 
                (number of not shared tweets)/(total number of tweets inside the community).
                Therefore, a <em>high value</em> of the Isolation index indicates a highly isolated community. 
            </p>

            <p>

                Furthermore, to evaluate the accuracy of the detected communities with respect to the global graph, 
                the network density metric has been calculated following the formula:
            </p>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <mi>network density</mi>
                    <mo>=</mo>
                    <mfrac>
                        <mi> 2m </mi>
                        <mi>n(n - 1)</mi>
                    </mfrac>
                </math>

            <p>
                where n is the number of hashtags (or nodes) and m is the number of edges in the hashtag network. 
                The global network density was <span id="network_density"></span> with <span id="network_nodes"></span> nodes 
                and <span id="network_edges"></span> edges.                 
                The range density for the main 8 communities is between 0.016 and 0.051, 
                with an average of 0.026, 5.25 times greater than the overall density, a good indication of separated groups.

                            The fifth community detected in terms of the number of hashtags is about the <em>Covid tracker ireland</em> mobile contact tracing app.

                            With an isolation index value close to that of the second community, almost half of the hashtags of this community are connected 
                            to hashtags outside the community. Moreover, considering the detected relevant EMM news items, they are 38, with 20 of them being 
                            relevant with the isolated tweets (notice that the majority of relevant news is relevant with isolated tweets).

                            communities (but not as many as the first one). Indeed, the interconnection index has a high value and the 
                            interesting hashtags that mostly contribute in the interconnections are <em>ireland, covid Ireland, Dublin and level</em>.

                            With a very high value of isolation, this community contains few hashtags connected to hashtags that are outside the community. 
                            Moreover, considering the detected relevant EMM news items, they are two, with one of them being relevant with the isolated tweets (notice the very low number of relevant news items).
